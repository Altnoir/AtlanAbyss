## Preface
This is a Minecraft Forge-based integration package.

The project was launched in early 2023. At first, it was just a package to play with friends, but with the gradual improvement, the content of the integration package became more and more perfect.
 
This is also the first time I made such a perfect deep magic modification integration package, including science and technology, adventure, pension and other elements, and from the beginning, I did not know any programming language, so I could only write directly by copying Kubijs' Wiki;
 
but then, as my needs were gradually not met on the Wiki (mainly Wiki content is too little), I went to study JavaScript;
 
then, I began to feel that Kubijs still could not achieve some functions, so I went to study the original data package;
 
and then... the package was gone...
 
how could it be, otherwise there would not be this repository, although the files of the package were really lost at the beginning, but fortunately it took 1 天之前 to recover most of the files, and the rest were manually restored by memory.
